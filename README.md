# MaxDepth.io

"the [maximum operating depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_operating_depth) of a breathing gas is the depth below which the partial pressure of oxygen of the gas mix exceeds an acceptable limit"

This blog is based on the jekyll-uno theme which is a minimal, responsive theme for Jekyll based on the [Uno](https://github.com/daleanthony/Uno) theme for Ghost. A demo of the original theme can be found [here](http://joshgerdes.com/jekyll-uno/).

It uses GitHub issues for comments based on original code from [donw.io](https://github.com/dwilliamson/donw.io)

This blog is an open forum for sharing my opinions on technology I am currently using or learning as well as other hobbies I may journal about including general aviation, scuba diving, travel, and more.
